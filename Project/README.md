# Project

We finish movies DAO implementation and actors DAO implementation.

You can insert movies by:
http://localhost:8080/movies/movie-list.html
1. Click Create button and edit to create the movie you want.

You can insert actors for a movie by:
http://localhost:8080/createActorsForMovies/{movie_id};
1. We are having troubles to display all the actors in http://localhost:8080/movies/actor-list.html

You can retrieve all the actors by:
http://localhost:8080/findAllActors

We try to fix the problems, and this is the current version we have right now, Thank you.
