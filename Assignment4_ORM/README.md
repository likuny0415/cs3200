# Assignment 4 - ORM

Some adjustments made based on the source code provided by the professor

1. I didn't delete the original code from the folder provided by the professor and I wrote code based on it.
2. Instead of creating a home.html file in src/main/webapp/movies/home.html, I create
a index.html file in src/main/webapp
3. My work start from http://localhost:8080/ instead of http://localhost:8080/movies
4. My movie-list start from http://localhost:8080/movie-list instead of http://localhost:8080/movies
